## Code Refactor

# Refactoring the starter code to make it more accessible and consolidating the CSS file to make it less bloated.

In this project I refactored starter code to make this website more accessible for people with screen readers, etc. 
I added accessible alt attributes for all images on the page.
I also changed elements of the HTML into semantic in order for it to be more readable code. 
I then consolidated the CSS selectors to make the code more efficient and less bulky. 
I also redid heading elements to make them fall in sequential order throughout the HTML file. 
Laslty I updated the page title to make it more specific and direct.
